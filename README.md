IGL - instant grammar and lexicon - will be adatabase for linguistic analyses for a linux system. 
It will combine a tool for morphological glossings, lexical analyses, translations and underway commentaries.
The tool will be adjustable to the individual requirements of each processed language. A grammar, a dictionary and a bibliography will be generated from the information included in the glossed file. Optionally, sound files may be included directly into the glossed text.
